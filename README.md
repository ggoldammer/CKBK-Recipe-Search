CKBK is an application that retrieves recipes based on the ingredients added to the search bar. Any ingredient can be used and will return the most relevant results

This was the second group project for the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp.

## Solution

Our solution was to use the powerful API, Edemam. Edemam allow us to query any ingredient and it will return multiple recipe objects with a wide range of data, from ingredients, to cooking steps, nutrition and more. We connected everything we needed between the backend and front end and had it display up to 10 results per query.

## Technologies Used

- Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- Bulma (CSS Library)
- JavaScript (Programming Language)
- jQuery (JavaScript Library)
- mySQL / Sequelize (Database / ORM)
- Passport JS (Node Js Middleware)
- Node Js
- Express
- Edemam API

## Scale & Future Improvements

- Adding aesthetic improvements on the Front-End to make it all lay out nicer
- Adding tags to each recipe, detailing allergic and dietary notices
- Expanding on the Passport Js concept to allow more member functionality
- General refactoring of code since a lot was experimentation
